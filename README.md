FancyMidi
=========

- For Linux only. Windows user may get this program working if they handle the MIDI issues.
- The parameters are optimized for Nord Stage 2 keyboard. 
If you use an other keyboard, domains and names of parameters are probably wrong or not useable.

Receive MIDI commands, display them or use them as input parameters for your computation.
Once the computation has finished, send the computed commands back to the keyboard.

This allows you to have extremely flexible control over parameters of your keyboard.
E.g. you can manipulate the organ drawbars with respect to time, so you have time dependent organ voice.

You can also improve the morphing capabilities of the NS2, e.g. changing the waveform or release parameter of the synth secition by means of control pedal.

Other sophisticated scenarios are imagineable, e.g. octaving the currently played tones, switching programs by playing a particular tone (combination/sequence), introducing more oscilators and connecting them to arbitrary parameters, ...
